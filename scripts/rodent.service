# Security hardening notes:
#
# IMPORTANT: Do not enable PrivateTmp, ReadWritePaths, or similar directives
# that create mount namespaces. ZFS operations require visibility of the host
# mount table. Mount namespace isolation causes:
# - "dataset is busy" errors on destroy
# - Filesystems appear unmounted despite canmount=on
# - Mounts exist in Rodent's namespace but not on host
#
# Rodent uses sudo-based operations (privilege.SudoFileOperations) for
# privileged file access to /etc/samba, /etc/hosts, /etc/krb5.conf, etc.
# Security is enforced via:
# - Code-level allowedPaths validation in privilege.SudoFileOperations
# - /etc/sudoers.d/rodent limiting permitted commands
# - Command validation in command.CommandExecutor
#
# See: https://github.com/stratastor/rodent/issues/54
