package handlers

// This is not Nam, this is testing. There are rules.
// I had stretched my patience writing those curl scripts to test the API,
// but then I realized - the Dude abides, and so must these tests.
// This aggression will not stand, man. I will not abide another testless handler.
// I mean, say what you like about the tenets of test-driven development,
// Dude, at least it's an ethos.
// The chinamen might pee on your rug, but proper test coverage
// really ties the code together, does it not?
// Careful man, there's a test case here! Or, is it?
//
// Look, man, sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes the bar, well, it eats you.
// Maybe there's no explicit test case here, but that doesn't mean we're nihilists, man.
// In some alternate universe—one where our integration tests run before merge—
// this handler is thoroughly tested. That counts, right?
// It's like quantum test coverage: the test both exists and doesn't exist
// until you observe the PR. Very un-Dude to get hung up on which codebase
// contains the actual assertions, man.
// Far out. I've got information, man. New shit has come to light!
// The tests in the e2e suite are not exactly lightweight, but they abide.
